*** THE BOOK ***

On the night of May 22 2010, when Mourinhoâs Inter arrived on the top of Europe and won the clubâs third Champions League, to raise the trophy that had been waited and pursued for so long cannot be anybody other than the captain of many battles, Javier Zanetti.

Arrived as an unknown youngster in the hands of President Moratti, back in 1995, Zanetti has indissolubly linked his career with the black and blue shirt, the last âbandieraâ (flag) in a sport of football where great champions often leave their roots. Everyone, from teammates to coaches, from supporters to opponents, admires his technical qualities as well as the tenacity and perseverance that he has brought to the game: today just like 20 years ago, the enthusiasm from him is always the same, his heart and many runs, he raises from the midfield to the attack, grinding thousand and thousand of miles on the wings.

His nickname is âEl Trator,â or the tractor. A champion on and off the field as Zanetti has created Fondazione Pupi (Pupi Foudation) to help the children of all ages in Buenos Aries where he was born and grew up in. To help the family, he worked as a bricklayer with his father or delivered milk by getting up at three in the morning.

On the night of triumph at the Santiago Bernabeu in Madrid, it is not very difficult to recognize someone with that face of wild joy, with the cup that he wore on his head like a hat, the authoritative captain who is able to speak just by the way he plays on the field and that is an example greater than any screams that he could have done. That is an example that assures everyone to consider him as the heir of another great captain in the history of Inter, Giacinto Facchetti. Maybe because they did not know that as a kid, Javier Zanetti was already serious, determined and âlucky and happyâ as he defines his exceptional sporting adventure at Inter. Within him, likes a bit of that DNA from the madness of his one great team, the Pazza Inter with which, he has suffered greatly in both victories and sorrows. Who is proud for many trophies won, among them, the historic treble that no one can ever erase.

Looking back in his career together with Gianni Riotta (co-author), Zanetti puts aside the public figure and talks about everything on the field, reliving the never ending game of a little boy in Buenos Aires who played in muddy fields and at 40 years old, he has won everything. However, he has never forgotten that, if there is another opportunity for him to raise another trophy, he must value what he believes in and what is his work and family. Because chasing after the guys who are half his age and do not have as much breath, it takes character of a true man.
